# BentBoxBot

I am a fetish content creator.  My kink goes by the name ASFR (Alt-Sex-Fetish-Robot).  It is a technosexual fetish that revolves around fembots, mandroids, statues, and dolls.  The sites where I post -- I call them my digital pimps.  They put you to work, take a cut, and expect you to follow the rules. BentBox and ManyVids in particular have a feed feature where models regularly post photos, short vids, and GIFs to keep users interested. 
They each have their own set of features: BentBox allows you to post 10x per 24hrs while ManyVids allows you to pre-schedule posts up to 30days in advance with not limit.  On ManyVids, the top models post once every hour (and this was BEFORE the scheduled posts feature became public).  For a while, I felt like I had to keep up.  I produced work quickly and posted manually, spending roughly 2 hours each day scheduling hourly posts on ManyVids then scattering posts on other sites throughout the day.  But I could not keep this up.  I started to lose focus, post sporadically, then not at all. Constant posting is painfully cumbersome.

Hence the creation of this program.  

This program requires Node.JS framework and Puppeteer to run.  This version is specifically for BentBox.  BentBoxLogin.js is the foundation.  It lets you login and post.  Soon, I will split this program into two branches.  One will post photos and the other will post videos 10x a day every 24hrs with a prompt that I will have to update.  These media are randomly chosen from a folder you specify.

I would like to see this program become an accessible app with buttons and mobile portability, but I fear the backlash from these companies.  I do not want to be found out and shut down.
