# BentBoxBot

I am a fetish content creator for a kink community called ASFR (Alt-Sex-Fetish-Robot). It is a technosexual fetish that revolves around fembots, mandroids, statues, and dolls.  The sites where I post -- I call them my digital pimps.  They put you to work, take a cut, and expect you to follow the rules. For example, BentBox and ManyVids have a feed feature where models regularly post photos, short vids, and GIFs to keep users interested. The more you post in the feed, the better, and consistency is key.

Each site has its own set of features: BentBox allows you to post 10x per 24hrs while ManyVids allows you to pre-schedule unlimited posts up to 30days in advance.  On ManyVids, the top models post once every hour (and this was BEFORE the scheduled posts feature became public).  For a while, I felt like I had to keep up.  I produced work quickly and posted manually, spending roughly 2 hours each day scheduling hourly posts on ManyVids then scattering posts on other sites throughout the day.  But I could not keep this up.  I started to lose focus, post sporadically, then not at all. Constant posting is painfully cumbersome.

Hence the creation of this program.  

This program requires Node.JS framework and Puppeteer to run.  This version is specifically for BentBox.  BentBoxLogin.js is the foundation.  It lets you login and post a pic.  Soon, I will split this program into two branches.  One will post photos 5x a day and the other will post videos 5x a day every 24hrs.  These media are randomly chosen from a specified folder.

I would like to see this program become a full-fledged app with buttons and mobile portability, but I fear the backlash from these companies.  I do not want to be found out and shut down.
